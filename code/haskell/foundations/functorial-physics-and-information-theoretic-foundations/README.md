# Functorial Physics and Information-Theoretic Foundations

Implementation of the theoretical framework from "Functorial Physics and Information-Theoretic Foundations: Physical Laws as Consistency Conditions for Information-Theoretic Structures at Fundamental Scales".

## Overview

This Haskell implementation demonstrates the key concepts from the paper, showing how physical laws emerge as consistency conditions for information-theoretic structures. The framework unifies functorial physics with information theory to explain:

- Emergent spacetime from quantum entanglement
- Gauge theories as information automorphisms  
- The cosmological constant as information entropy
- Resolution of fine-tuning through fixed points
- Quantum error correction in spacetime

## Theory Summary

### Core Principles

1. **Information-Matter Correspondence**: Every physical configuration corresponds to an information pattern through a faithful functor F: Info → Phys.

2. **Emergent Spacetime**: Spacetime geometry emerges from quantum entanglement patterns via the scaling relation:
   ```
   I ∝ E^(3/4) × L^2
   ```

3. **Global Consistency**: Physical laws represent consistency conditions for information-theoretic structures, with fundamental constants as unique fixed points.

4. **Unified Constraint**: All physics is governed by the master constraint equation combining quantum energy, spatial curvature, entanglement, and information entropy.

### Key Results

- The cosmological constant Λ represents the universe's information processing capacity
- The fine structure constant α ≈ 1/137 is a unique fixed point of information flow
- Gauge symmetries emerge from local automorphisms of information complexes
- Spacetime implements quantum error correction ensuring stability

## Usage Examples

### Information-Energy Correspondence

```haskell
import Physics.Functorial

-- Calculate information content from energy and length scale
let energy = 1e10  -- GeV
    length = 1e-15  -- meters
    info = informationContent energy length 1.0
```

### Emergent Spacetime

```haskell
-- Create entanglement graph
let graph = EntanglementGraph vertices edges weights
    metric = emergentMetric graph position
```

### Gauge Theory Emergence

```haskell
-- Standard Model from information structure
let smGauge = constructSMGauge
    higgs = informationCondensation infoDensity
```

### Unified Constraint

```haskell
-- Solve the unified constraint equation
let constraint = UnifiedConstraint {...}
    physicalStates = solveConstraint constraint
```

## Experimental Predictions

The framework makes several testable predictions:

1. **Modified Dispersion Relations**: High-energy particles show deviations from special relativity
2. **Information-Dependent Gravity**: Gravitational coupling varies with local information content
3. **Gravitational Wave Echoes**: Information-theoretic corrections produce echo signatures
4. **CMB Modifications**: Primordial information patterns affect cosmic microwave background

## Mathematical Foundations

The implementation uses category theory concepts:

- **Categories**: Info and Phys categories with appropriate morphisms
- **Functors**: The fundamental functor F: Info → Phys
- **Monoidal Structure**: For entanglement and tensor products
- **Higher Categories**: 2-categories for theory relationships
