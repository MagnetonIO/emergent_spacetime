# Spectral Information Theory - Haskell Implementation

This is a Haskell implementation of the mathematical framework from the paper "Spectral Theory of Information-Energy Operators in Emergent Spacetime: Connecting Schrödinger Spectral Analysis with Quantum Error Correction".

## Overview

The code implements:
- Information density operators as generalizations of Schrödinger Hamiltonians
- Spectral analysis for discrete/continuous/resonance spectra
- Information-energy correspondence (E = c²ε)
- Quantum error correction in the context of emergent spacetime
- Scattering theory for information patterns
- Computational methods for solving the spectral problems

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- GHC 8.10 or later
- Cabal 3.0 or later
- hmatrix library (requires BLAS/LAPACK)

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies (may need system libraries for hmatrix)
# On macOS: brew install openblas
# On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev

# Build the project
cabal build

# Run the examples
cabal run spectral-information
```

## Module Structure

- **SpectralTypes.hs**: Core type definitions including `InformationDensity`, `Eigenvalue`, `SpectralDecomposition`, etc.
- **InformationOperator.hs**: Construction and manipulation of information density operators
- **SpectralSolver.hs**: Numerical methods for solving eigenvalue problems
- **ErrorCorrection.hs**: Quantum error correction and spacetime stability analysis
- **ScatteringTheory.hs**: Scattering amplitudes and cross-sections for information patterns
- **Main.hs**: Example calculations demonstrating key results from the paper

## Key Concepts

### Information Density Operator
The fundamental object is the information density operator:
```
Î ψ(x) = I(x)ψ(x) + ∇·[D(x)∇ψ(x)]
```
where I(x) is the local information density and D(x) is the diffusion tensor.

### Spectrum Classification
- **Discrete spectrum**: Bound states (localized information patterns)
- **Continuous spectrum**: Scattering states (propagating disturbances)  
- **Resonances**: Metastable configurations with complex eigenvalues

### Information-Energy Correspondence
Energy and information density are related by:
```
E = c²ε + O(ε²/M_P c²)
```

### Spacetime Stability
Emergent spacetime is stable when:
1. The information operator has a spectral gap
2. The continuous threshold exceeds the critical decoherence threshold

## Example Usage

```haskell
-- Create an information field
let field = createPotentialWell 100 5.0 10.0

-- Construct the operator
let op = constructInformationOperator field 100 Dirichlet

-- Solve for the spectrum
let spectral = solveSpectrum op 10

-- Check spacetime stability
let stable = checkSpacetimeStability spectral errorParams
```

## Physical Predictions

The framework makes testable predictions for:
- Modified dispersion relations at high energies
- Gravitational wave spectroscopy signatures
- Black hole entropy from information density
- Quantum error correction thresholds for stable geometry
