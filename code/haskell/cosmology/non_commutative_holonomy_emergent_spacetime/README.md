# Non-Commutative Holonomy in Emergent Informational Spacetime

A Haskell implementation of the theoretical framework presented in "Non-Commutative Holonomy in Emergent Informational Spacetime: A Categorical Foundation for Galaxy Dynamics and Quantum Geometry" by Matthew Long.

## Overview

This project implements a categorical framework where spacetime emerges from informational structures, and non-commutative holonomy explains galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter. The code demonstrates how the failure of transitive morphism composition in informational categories leads to observable effects like flat galaxy rotation curves.

## Theory Summary

### Core Concepts

1. **Information-First Ontology**: Physical reality emerges from categorical relationships between informational objects, not from fundamental particles or fields.

2. **Non-Commutative Holonomy Lemma**: When local isomorphisms exist between informational objects A ↔ B but no morphism connects A → C, the holonomy around loops becomes path-dependent and globally obstructed, resulting in non-commutative behavior.

3. **Emergent Spacetime**: Geometric properties like curvature and torsion arise from patterns of connectivity in the informational category.

4. **Galaxy Dynamics**: Flat rotation curves result from non-commutative holonomy phases accumulated along informational paths through the galaxy structure.

### Mathematical Framework

The implementation uses:
- **Category Theory**: Objects represent informational states, morphisms represent transformations
- **Higher Categories**: Path composition and holonomy groups
- **Differential Geometry**: Connections, curvature, and parallel transport
- **Complex Analysis**: Holonomy phases and Berry phases

## Key Components

### Category Module
- `InfoObject`: Represents informational states with associated data
- `InfoMorphism`: Transformations between informational states
- `InfoCategory`: Categorical structure with composition and identity
- `ObstructedCategory`: Categories with missing morphisms (key to non-commutativity)

### Holonomy Module
- `HolonomyElement`: Represents holonomy with matrix representation and phase
- `NonCommutativeHolonomy`: Holonomy structure for loops in information space
- `computeHolonomy`: Calculates holonomy for paths in the category
- `nonCommutativeLemma`: Verifies the core theoretical lemma

### Geometry Module
- `InformationalManifold`: Emergent manifold from information flow
- `Connection`: Parallel transport in information space
- `Curvature`: Riemann, Ricci, and scalar curvature
- `EmergentSpacetime`: Complete geometric structure

### Galaxy Module
- `GalaxyModel`: Galaxy representation with informational category
- `computeHolonomicRotation`: Rotation velocity including holonomy effects
- `generateRotationCurve`: Creates theoretical rotation curves
- `informationalDensityProfile`: Information density as function of radius

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- GHC 9.2 or higher
- Cabal 3.6 or higher

### Build
```bash
cabal build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
cabal test
```

### Run Galaxy Simulation
```bash
cabal run galaxy-simulation
```

## Example Output

The galaxy simulation demonstrates:
1. Construction of informational category for a galaxy
2. Verification of category properties
3. Generation of rotation curves with holonomy corrections
4. Comparison with Newtonian predictions
5. Information density profiles

## Theoretical Predictions

1. **Flat Rotation Curves**: Emerge naturally from accumulated holonomy phases
2. **MOND-like Behavior**: Appears in certain regimes without additional parameters
3. **Tully-Fisher Relation**: Arises from scaling properties of information flow
4. **No Dark Matter Particles**: Effects explained by topological/categorical properties

## Future Work

- Implement full N-body simulations with holonomy
- Add gravitational lensing predictions
- Explore cosmological implications
- Develop experimental tests to distinguish from particle dark matter
