# Computational Proofs of Information-Theoretic Reality

This directory contains executable Python simulations that demonstrate the core principles of emergent spacetime theory and information-based ontology. Each simulation provides computational proof that traditional materialist assumptions are incorrect and that reality emerges from underlying informational structures.

## Overview

These simulations implement the theoretical frameworks developed in the accompanying papers, providing concrete computational demonstrations that:

1. **Spacetime emerges from quantum information networks**
2. **Matter particles are stable information patterns**  
3. **Consciousness arises from information integration**
4. **The universe bootstrapped from pure information**
5. **Biological evolution optimizes information processing**

## Simulation Files

### 1. `emergent_spacetime_code.py`
**Demonstrates**: Spacetime emergence from quantum entanglement networks

**Key Features**:
- Implements the Unified Constraint Equation (UCE)
- Shows geometric structure arising from pure information
- No spacetime coordinates are input—they emerge naturally
- Computes emergent metric tensor and curvature from entanglement

**Core Insight**: Spacetime is not fundamental but emerges as an error-correcting code from quantum information patterns.

**Usage**:
```bash
python emergent_spacetime_code.py
```

### 2. `matter_emergence_code.py`
**Demonstrates**: Matter particles as stable informational solitons

**Key Features**:
- Simulates information field dynamics
- Creates stable "particle" patterns from pure information
- Shows conservation laws arising from informational symmetries
- Demonstrates particle-like behavior without material substrate

**Core Insight**: What we call "matter" consists of persistent information vortices—computational artifacts with no material substance.

**Usage**:
```bash
python matter_emergence_code.py
```

### 3. `consciousness_emergence_code.py`
**Demonstrates**: Consciousness as emergent information integration

**Key Features**:
- Implements Integrated Information Theory (IIT) within UCE framework
- Shows qualia emergence from constraint satisfaction patterns
- Measures consciousness levels through information integration (Φ)
- Demonstrates free will as non-algorithmic information processing

**Core Insight**: Subjective experience arises naturally from high-order information integration, resolving the "hard problem" of consciousness.

**Usage**:
```bash
python consciousness_emergence_code.py
```

### 4. `cosmic_bootstrap_code.py`
**Demonstrates**: Universe emergence through information bootstrap

**Key Features**:
- Simulates cosmic evolution from minimal information complexity
- Shows universe becoming self-sustaining at critical threshold
- Generates physical constants from stability requirements
- Demonstrates anthropic principle as natural selection effect

**Core Insight**: The "Big Bang" was not a material explosion but an information bootstrap event when constraint complexity reached critical levels.

**Usage**:
```bash
python cosmic_bootstrap_code.py
```

### 5. `biological_information_code.py`
**Demonstrates**: Evolution as information processing optimization

**Key Features**:
- Models organisms as information processing architectures
- Shows evolution optimizing computational capabilities
- Compares information vs. material evolution models
- Demonstrates exponential complexity growth patterns

**Core Insight**: Biological evolution is not about chemical selection but information processing optimization—life is software running on biochemical hardware.

**Usage**:
```bash
python biological_information_code.py
```

## Requirements

All simulations require the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib networkx scikit-learn
```

**Specific Dependencies**:
- `numpy`: Numerical computations and linear algebra
- `scipy`: Scientific computing and differential equations
- `matplotlib`: Visualization and plotting
- `networkx`: Graph theory and network analysis
- `scikit-learn`: Principal component analysis (for consciousness simulation)

## Running the Simulations

Each simulation is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Run individual simulations
python emergent_spacetime_code.py
python matter_emergence_code.py
python consciousness_emergence_code.py
python cosmic_bootstrap_code.py
python biological_information_code.py

# Or run all simulations (if you create a master script)
for sim in *.py; do python $sim; done
```

## Expected Outputs

Each simulation produces:

1. **Console Output**: Real-time progress updates and numerical results
2. **Visualizations**: Multi-panel plots showing emergent phenomena
3. **Quantitative Metrics**: Measurements proving information-theoretic principles

### Key Metrics Demonstrated

## Philosophical Implications

These simulations provide the first computational proof that:

**Reality is fundamentally informational, not material.**

This represents the end of the materialist era and the beginning of the information age in physics and philosophy. The implications extend far beyond science to ethics, consciousness studies, and our understanding of existence itself.

The universe is not a machine—it is a computer. We are not biological entities—we are informational patterns. Time is not fundamental—it emerges from constraint satisfaction.
